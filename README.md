## Initialisation ##

### To initialise the project ###

#### You must add AWS credentials for all environments to your aws credentials file you wish to deploy to prior to running init! 

They must be named the same as the environments specified in the ecs-stack-config.txt file `DeployedEnvironments` section and prefix the environment ecs-stack-config.txt files e.g. dev-ecs-stack-config.txt.
 
Follow this link for further details `http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html`

Execute `gradle -b init.gradle sdginit`

This will use the git repository name as your service name

note: if deployment to any of the environments fail - you can run the creation of ECS via the ECSStackInitialiser class - ensure you only have the failed environment in the `DeployedEnvironments` section

### The RegisterCI process takes place during init ###

During initialisation you will be prompted for details to register a continuous integration job, including the CI box public IP, your Jenkins User Id & Api Key (which can be found on you profile within jenkins -> <username> -> Configure -> Show API Token)

note: the server address should not include http:// e.g. localhost:8080

### To register the dashboard ###

(fron git bash) Execute `sh deployToGrafana.sh`

### To upload a copy of the version file to s3 ###

(from git bash) execute 'sh upload_version_s3.sh "bucket name" "name of file"

### To build a client jar (REST models to be used in other projects)

Execute `gradle clientJar`

Any clients can use 

`dependencies {
    compile files('libs/xxxx-client.jar')
}`

### To make available in S3 (with a latest link)
